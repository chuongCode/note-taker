# Note-taker Platform

This is a small application where users save thoughts, ideas, and other information in the form of notes. Each note comes with a title and a main content body. Notes can be categorized under topics to help users categorize their thoughts. Host is: https://note-taker-beryl.vercel.app/
As of right now, the host is idle and inactive.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
